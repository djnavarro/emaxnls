\item{dose}{Nominal dose, units not specified}
\item{exposure_1}{Exposure value, units and metric not specified}
\item{exposure_2}{Exposure value, units and metric not specified, but different from exposure_1}
\item{response_1}{Continuous response value (units not specified)}
\item{response_2}{Binary response value (group labels not specified)}
\item{cnt_a}{Continuous valued covariate}

\description{
Sample simulated data for Emax exposure-response models with covariates.
}
\details{
This simulated dataset is entirely synthetic. It is a generic data set that can be used
to illustrate Emax modeling. It contains variables corresponding to dose and exposure,
and includes both a continuous response variable and a binary response variable. Three
continuous valued covariates are included, along with two binary covariates.

You can find the data generating code in the package source code,
under \code{R/data.R}
